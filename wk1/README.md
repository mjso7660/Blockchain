# Assignment:

## Requirements
Using	Java	or	Python,	write	appropriately	commented	code	to	create	a singly-linked	
list of	say	10	items	with	the	following functionality:  
(1) Traverse	the	list	and	print	out	the	items;	if	empty	list,	print	that  
(2) Add	an	item	to	head	of	list  
(3) Add	an	item	to	tail	of	list  
(4) Add	an	item	after	a	node	with	a	certain	key  
(5) Delete	an	item	with	a	certain	key  
   For	fun:  
(6) Deep	copy	of	linked	list	O(n)	vs	O(n2)  
(7) Reverse	the	list  
(8) One	other	functionality	that	can	think	off  

## Implementation

(1) is implemented by .traversal()  
(2) is implemented by .push(key, value)  
(3) is implemented by .append(key, value)  
(4) is implemented by .insert_after_key(key1, key, value)  
(5) is implemented by .deleted(key)  
(6) is implemented by deep_copy(list)  
(7) is implemented by .reverse()  
(8) is implemented by check_same(list1, list2)
